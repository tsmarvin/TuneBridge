# Copilot Instructions for TuneBridge

## Communication Guidelines

- Do NOT create documentation files (e.g., SECURITY_UPDATE.md, CHANGELOG.md, etc.) to communicate changes or updates
- Communicate all updates, explanations, and information through PR comments instead
- Keep documentation minimal and only create files when specifically requested by the repository owner
