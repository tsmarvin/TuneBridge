# Local Development with Aspire

BridgeBeats uses [.NET Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/) for local development orchestration, providing a dashboard with distributed tracing, structured logging, and resource monitoring.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 10.0 SDK or later
- Docker Desktop (for running Redis locally)
- API credentials configured (see [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md))
- A running Redis instance reachable from your machine (see [Provide Redis](#provide-redis) below)

## Provide Redis

The AppHost adds Redis as a **connection-string resource only** (`AddConnectionString("redis")`). Aspire does not start Redis for you, in development or in production. You must run Redis yourself and tell the AppHost where to find it through the `redis` connection string. If the connection string is missing, the AppHost writes an error to stderr and the components that depend on Redis will fail.

Start a local Redis with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name bridgebeats-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:8-alpine
```

Then point the AppHost at it with user secrets (recommended) or an environment variable:

```bash
# User secrets (scoped to the AppHost project)
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:redis" "localhost:6379" \
  --project src/BridgeBeats.AppHost/BridgeBeats.AppHost.csproj

# Or an environment variable for the current shell
export ConnectionStrings__redis="localhost:6379"
```

> Verify: the connection-string key the AppHost reads is `ConnectionStrings:redis` (env-var form `ConnectionStrings__redis`), confirmed in `src/BridgeBeats.AppHost/Program.cs`. The exact local Redis host/port is your choice; `localhost:6379` matches the Docker command above.

## Quick Start

From the repository root, with Redis running and its connection string set:

```bash
aspire run
```

The terminal displays a **Dashboard URL with an authentication token**:

```
Dashboard:  https://localhost:17239/login?t=abc123tokenhere
```

Open this URL to access the Aspire Dashboard. The token is part of the URL; copy the whole line.

If you prefer to run the host directly without the Aspire CLI, use `dotnet run` from the AppHost project. You still get the orchestrated processes, but `aspire run` is the recommended path for the dashboard experience.

## Aspire Dashboard Features

The dashboard provides:

- **Resources view**: monitor each application component and its health status
- **Structured logs**: view application logs with filtering and search
- **Distributed traces**: trace requests across services
- **Metrics**: view application performance metrics

## Project Structure

The Aspire integration consists of:

| Project | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `BridgeBeats.AppHost` | Orchestration entry point - declares every component and its dependencies |
| `BridgeBeats.ServiceDefaults` | Shared service configuration (OpenTelemetry, resilience, health checks) |

The AppHost provisions the web application plus the provider workers (Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal), the Discord worker, the saga coordinator, the JetStream watcher, and the cache bootstrap worker. A provider worker is added only when its credentials are configured. All components share the single Redis resource.

## Environment Variables

The AppHost threads configuration and secrets through as Aspire parameters using the `BridgeBeats__Section__Key` (double-underscore) convention. Provide them through any of:

1. **User Secrets** (recommended for development):

   ```bash
   dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:SpotifyClientId" "your-client-id" \
     --project src/BridgeBeats.AppHost/BridgeBeats.AppHost.csproj
   ```

   The AppHost reads provider credentials from the `Parameters:` configuration section (env-var form `Parameters__SpotifyClientId`).

2. **Environment variables**: set in your shell or IDE launch configuration.

3. **appsettings.json**: for non-sensitive configuration only.

## Aspire vs Production Docker Compose

| Aspect | Aspire (`aspire run`) | Docker Compose (`docker compose up`) |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Local development and debugging | Production deployment |
| **Dashboard** | Built-in with full telemetry | Aspire Dashboard fronted by Caddy |
| **Hot reload** | Supported (project resources) | Requires rebuild |
| **Reverse proxy** | Not included | Caddy with SSL/TLS |
| **Redis** | You run it; set the connection string | Run by the compose file |
| **Secrets** | Environment / user secrets | Docker secrets |

### When to Use Each

- **Use `aspire run`** for:
  - Day-to-day development
  - Debugging and testing
  - Exploring telemetry and logs

- **Use `docker compose up`** for:
  - Production deployments
  - CI/CD pipeline testing
  - Replicating the production environment locally

When using Docker Compose, change to the `containers/` directory first:

```bash
cd containers
docker compose up -d
```

In the compose topology, Redis runs as its own service, so the manual Redis step above does not apply.

## Generating Deployment Artifacts

Aspire can generate Docker Compose files for deployment prototyping:

```bash
aspire publish
```

> Verify: the output location for `aspire publish` is set by the Aspire CLI, not by the AppHost code. Check the command output for the generated path before relying on it.

> **Note**: Generated compose files are for development and prototyping. The production `docker-compose.yml` in `containers/` is the supported deployment, with Caddy, health checks, persistent volumes, and Docker-secret management.

## Troubleshooting

### Redis connection errors on startup

If components log Redis connection failures, confirm Redis is running and the `redis` connection string is set (see [Provide Redis](#provide-redis)). The AppHost does not start Redis for you.

### Port conflicts

If you see port-binding errors, ensure no other instance is already running. The Aspire CLI prompts when an instance is detected.

### Missing dependencies

Confirm the prerequisites are installed:

```bash
dotnet --version  # Should be 10.0+
docker --version  # Docker must be running
```

### Dashboard not loading

1. Use the full URL including the authentication token (`?t=...`).
2. Confirm the terminal shows the application started successfully.
3. Stop and restart with `aspire run`.
