# Spotify bulk-batch and queue routing

This is a developer-facing explanation of how BridgeBeats batches single-id Spotify
lookups and orders work across the priority queue. It covers the design and the
reasoning behind the constants, not a step-by-step task. Type and member names below
are links by name into the source; line numbers are deliberately omitted because they
go stale.

## Overview

Spotify's Web API lets a caller fetch many ids in one request: up to 50 tracks per
`GET /tracks?ids=...` call and up to 20 albums per `GET /albums?ids=...` call. Issuing
one HTTP round-trip per id wastes that capacity and burns rate-limit budget faster than
necessary. The batch path exists to amortize those round-trips: single-id track and
album lookups that do not need an immediate answer are diverted onto dedicated Redis
streams, accumulated, and then resolved in multi-id batch calls.

The moving parts:

- `SpotifyBulkQueueDecorator` (in `BridgeBeats.Core.Infrastructure.Queue`) wraps the
  Spotify request queue and re-routes non-interactive `SongIdLookup` and `AlbumIdLookup`
  enqueues onto type-specific bulk streams.
- `SpotifyBatchQueueHelper` owns the consumer-group lifecycle, depth and age inspection,
  batch dequeue, acknowledgement, and bounded requeue for those bulk streams.
- `SpotifyBulkProcessorService` is the background service that decides when to flush each
  stream, calls the bulk API, and applies each result to its saga.
- `RedisRequestQueue<T>` is the generic per-provider queue. It does not handle the
  type-specific bulk streams; it governs how the interactive, background, and bulk lanes
  of the generic queue are ordered during dequeue.
- `JetStreamWatcherService` is one producer that feeds the bulk lane: it discovers music
  links on the Bluesky firehose and enqueues them at bulk priority.

The single-id-to-bulk diversion applies only to Spotify, because only the Spotify path
has a decorator and a bulk processor wired up for it.

## Queue lanes and dequeue ordering

Each provider's generic queue (`RedisRequestQueue<T>`) has four Redis streams, keyed by
the lower-cased provider name:

- `queue:{provider}:interactive` — highest priority; a user is waiting.
- `queue:{provider}:background` — work that can wait.
- `queue:{provider}:bulk` — lowest priority; the generic bulk lane.
- `queue:{provider}:dlq` — the dead-letter queue (read by range, no consumer group).

Ordering is deterministic, not weighted-random. `QueueSettings.Weights`
(`PriorityWeights`) is retained for backward-compatible configuration but no longer drives
selection; the field's own remarks say so. The order for a given dequeue is produced by
`GetStreamDequeueOrder`, a pure method that takes the current dequeue counter and the
current queue depth.

### Interactive-first

On a normal (non-aging) call, the order is interactive, then background, then bulk. The
dequeue visits streams in that order and returns the first message it finds, so as long as
interactive work exists it is always served first.

### The aging escape hatch

Strict interactive-first ordering would let a steady stream of interactive work starve the
background and bulk lanes forever. To prevent that, every Nth dequeue is an "aging slot"
that demotes interactive and promotes a lower tier to the head of the order. N is
`QueueSettings.InteractiveAgingInterval`, default 8. A call is an aging slot when
`dequeueCounter % agingInterval == 0`.

The aging slots alternate which lower tier leads, so neither background nor bulk starves:

- Odd-numbered aging slots: background leads (`background, interactive, bulk`).
- Even-numbered aging slots: bulk leads (`bulk, interactive, background`).

The slot index is `dequeueCounter / agingInterval`, and its parity selects which tier
leads. A configured interval of 1 or less is treated as misconfiguration — at N=1 every
single dequeue would demote interactive — so the queue logs a warning and falls back to
the default of 8 (`RedisRequestQueue<T>` validates this in its constructor; `QueueSettings`
documents the same fallback).

### Bulk gating

Bulk is only worth serving once enough has accumulated to batch. `GetStreamDequeueOrder`
gates the bulk lane: bulk is included in the order only when its depth reaches the
per-provider minimum threshold. Below the threshold, bulk is dropped from the order
entirely (and on an even aging slot, background leads instead, since there is no eligible
bulk to alternate with).

The threshold comes from `QueueSettings.GetMinBulkThreshold`, which returns the
per-provider override from `ProviderMinBulkThresholds` or falls back to
`DefaultMinBulkQueueThreshold`, default 5. Setting the effective threshold to 0 or 1
disables gating, so bulk is always eligible.

Note the two distinct meanings of "bulk" here. This gating governs the generic
`queue:{provider}:bulk` lane inside `RedisRequestQueue<T>`. The Spotify type-specific
bulk streams described next are separate, and the bulk processor applies its own
size-or-age flush rather than this dequeue-order gating.

## Bulk batching

`SpotifyBulkProcessorService` runs a loop on a 500 ms check interval. Each cycle it asks
whether the track-id stream and the album-id stream should flush, and processes whichever
qualify. The flush decision is a pure predicate, `ShouldFlush`, so it can be tested in
isolation.

### Size-or-age flush

`ShouldFlush(count, oldestAge, threshold, linger)` returns true when either condition
holds:

- Size: `count >= threshold`. For tracks the threshold is
  `SpotifyConstants.MaxTracksPerBatchLookup` (50); for albums it is
  `SpotifyConstants.MaxAlbumsPerBatchLookup` (20). These match the Spotify Web API page
  limits, so a full batch is exactly one maximal API call.
- Age: there is at least one queued item and the oldest item's age has reached the linger
  window. The processor only computes the oldest-item age when the stream is below its size
  threshold, because at or above the threshold the size condition already fires.

Size is the primary trigger. A stream that fills to 50 tracks (or 20 albums) flushes
immediately; the age path is the backstop for low-volume streams that never reach the
size threshold. The oldest enqueue time is read from the stream's first entry —
Redis streams are time-ordered, so the first entry is the oldest
(`SpotifyBatchQueueHelper.GetOldestEnqueuedAtAsync`). A malformed `enqueuedAt` field is
logged and treated as absent so a bad timestamp cannot wedge the age decision.

A flush is also suppressed when the relevant bulk endpoint is rate-limited or the stream
is in request-failure cooldown (see Reliability).

### The linger default and saga-TTL reconciliation

The linger window is `SpotifyBatchSettings.LingerMs`, config key
`BridgeBeats:Spotify:Batch:LingerMs`, bound from the section
`BridgeBeats:Spotify:Batch`. Its default, `SpotifyBatchSettings.DefaultLingerMs`, is
`86_400_000` ms — 24 hours. A non-positive configured value is clamped back to that
default, so batching's age backstop cannot be disabled by misconfiguration.

A 24-hour age backstop is much larger than a latency bound would be, and that is
intentional. Because size is the real flush trigger, the linger is not there to bound how
long a request waits; it is a staleness drain for streams that never fill. Setting it that
high effectively turns off time-based flushing for normally-trafficked streams while still
guaranteeing a low-volume stream eventually drains.

The size of that default is constrained from below by saga expiry. `QueueSettings.JobExpirationMinutes`
is the number of minutes before an incomplete job or saga expires; its default is `2880`
(48 hours). The relationship the `JobExpirationMinutes` comment references: a saga can be
created when a request is enqueued and then sit in a bulk stream until the next flush. If
the saga's time-to-live were shorter than the linger, the saga could be evicted before the
flush ever writes its result. `JobExpirationMinutes` must therefore exceed the linger
backstop. The 48-hour default is 2× the 24-hour linger, which keeps visible margin between
"latest a batch can flush" and "earliest the saga can expire."

If you raise `LingerMs` past `JobExpirationMinutes`, you reintroduce that eviction race;
keep the saga TTL comfortably above the linger.

## Routing

### How typed id lookups reach the bulk streams

`SpotifyBulkQueueDecorator` decorates the Spotify `IRequestQueue<QueuedLookupRequest>`.
Its `EnqueueAsync` re-routes a request to a type-specific bulk stream only when both
conditions hold:

- the lookup type is `SongIdLookup` or `AlbumIdLookup`, and
- the priority is not `Interactive`.

When routed, `SongIdLookup` goes to `SpotifyConstants.BulkTrackIdStream`
(`queue:spotify:bulk:track-id`) and `AlbumIdLookup` goes to
`SpotifyConstants.BulkAlbumIdStream` (`queue:spotify:bulk:album-id`). The request is
serialized and written directly with `XADD`, carrying the `payload` and `enqueuedAt`
fields, and an enqueue metric is recorded at bulk priority so dashboards can tell
bulk-stream enqueues apart from generic ones.

Everything else passes through to the inner queue unchanged: interactive `SongIdLookup`
and `AlbumIdLookup` (so an interactive caller is served on the interactive lane with a
single-item call, preserving its latency budget), and every other lookup type at any
priority. All non-enqueue operations on the decorator delegate straight to the inner
queue.

Using the shared stream-name constants on both the producer and consumer side matters:
the constant's own remarks call out that a producer and consumer disagreeing on the stream
name is a silent failure where no messages are ever delivered.

### How firehose links land in the bulk lane

`JetStreamWatcherService` consumes the Bluesky Jetstream firehose, subscribing to the
`app.bsky.feed.post` and `app.bsky.feed.repost` collections. For each newly created record
it extracts candidate links from post facets, embedded external link cards, and the
subjects of quote posts and reposts (hydrating those through the Bluesky API). The watcher
is producer-only: it feeds the queue and never consumes results.

For each candidate link, `IdentifyProviderAsync` decides the provider and lookup type. The
checks run in a deliberate order — `spotify.link` short links first, then Spotify
track/album ids, then Tidal, then Apple Music. A Spotify track link becomes a
`SongIdLookup` and a Spotify album link becomes an `AlbumIdLookup`, both carrying the
resolved Spotify id as the lookup value. (Spotify prerelease links stay as `UriLookup` for
the generic worker; artist and playlist links are not recognized and are dropped.)

Every link the watcher enqueues is built as a `QueuedLookupRequest` with
`OriginPriority` set to `QueuePriority.Bulk` and enqueued at bulk priority through the
resolved provider queue. For Spotify track and album ids, that bulk-priority enqueue is
exactly the case `SpotifyBulkQueueDecorator` intercepts, so firehose-discovered Spotify
track/album links flow into the type-specific bulk streams rather than the generic
`queue:spotify:bulk` lane. Bulk origin priority is persisted into the saga so any
secondary lookups the coordinator spawns also stay out of the interactive lane. Enqueue
failures are logged and swallowed so one bad link does not interrupt the firehose.

## Reliability

The bulk path keeps work moving across crashes, bad data, and transient provider failures.

### Stale-entry recovery with XAUTOCLAIM

`SpotifyBatchQueueHelper` dequeues in two steps. First it runs an `XAUTOCLAIM` sweep to
reclaim pending entries that have been idle longer than `AutoClaimMinIdleMs` (60 seconds),
deserializing and appending them to the result; then it reads new entries with
`XREADGROUP`. Reclaimed entries count against the requested batch size, so a single
dequeue never returns more than asked. The 60-second idle threshold is chosen to be long
enough that a slow-but-alive processing cycle is never reclaimed, yet short enough that a
crashed consumer does not block the stream for more than a minute. There is exactly one
consumer service reading these streams, which is what makes reclaiming another consumer's
pending entries safe after the idle window.

`XAUTOCLAIM` requires Redis 6.2 or newer. If the server is older, the reclaim step throws,
is logged, and is skipped — the dequeue still reads new entries, only pending-entry
recovery is unavailable.

### Poison-entry handling

An entry with a missing payload, a payload that deserializes to a literal JSON null, or a
payload that cannot be deserialized is poison: retrying it can never succeed and would just
loop forever under repeated `XAUTOCLAIM` re-claims. Such entries are acknowledged and
deleted (`XACK` + `XDEL`) on both the reclaim and the new-read paths rather than retried,
so they leave the pending list permanently.

### Requeue cap and finalization

Requeue is bounded by `LookupConstants.MaxQueueRetryAttempts` (5), the same cap the generic
queue processor enforces. `SpotifyBatchQueueHelper.RequeueAsync` always acknowledges and
deletes the original entry first, then:

- if the current attempt count is below the cap, it re-adds a fresh entry with a new
  `enqueuedAt` and `AttemptCount + 1` and returns `Requeued`;
- if the cap is reached, or the payload cannot be deserialized to read its attempt count,
  it discards the message and returns `CapReached`;
- if the original entry no longer exists (already deleted, for example after an
  `XAUTOCLAIM` re-claim by a duplicate in flight), it returns `NotFound`.

The processor reacts to the outcome. On `CapReached` it writes a failed Spotify provider
state ("Bulk lookup failed after 5 attempts") and publishes saga-level and per-lookup
completion so the saga coordinator and any interactive waiter unblock instead of hanging.
On `NotFound` it leaves the saga untouched, since another consumer handled the entry.

### Failure shapes in the bulk dispatch

The processor distinguishes three failure shapes when resolving a batch:

- A rate limit (`RetryAfterExceededException`) records the endpoint rate limit, marks each
  affected saga partial, merges a rate-limit info entry for Spotify into the saga, publishes
  the `RATE_LIMITED` sentinel (`LookupConstants.RateLimitedSentinel`) so synchronous waiters
  are not left hanging on a 429, and requeues the whole batch.
- An empty result dictionary is treated as a request-level failure (network or auth error).
  No saga state is written; the whole batch is requeued and the stream's request-failure
  cooldown is armed.
- An absent key inside a non-empty result is a per-id partial: only that one message is
  requeued. A key that is present with a null value is a genuine not-found and is written as
  a not-found provider state, not requeued.

### Exponential cooldown after request failures

After an empty-dict request failure, the processor arms a per-stream cooldown so it does
not re-flush and burn retries faster than Spotify can recover. The base is
`SpotifyBatchSettings.RequestFailureCooldownSeconds` (config key
`BridgeBeats:Spotify:Batch:RequestFailureCooldownSeconds`, default 5; non-positive values
are clamped back to the default). `ComputeCooldownSeconds` doubles the base once per prior
consecutive failure, clamping the exponent at 5 to avoid overflow, and caps the result at
`SpotifyBatchSettings.MaxRequestFailureCooldownSeconds` (60). The track-id and album-id
streams each keep their own cooldown and consecutive-failure counter, so a failure on one
endpoint does not suppress flushes on the other. A successful batch dispatch resets that
stream's counter and clears its cooldown.

## Genre resolution

`SpotifyArtistGenreService` keeps the artist-to-genre cache fresh on a slow, rolling
schedule, separate from the per-request bulk path. It waits 30 seconds after startup, then
wakes on a 5-minute check interval. A full refresh runs only when 7 days have elapsed since
the last full run (`s_scheduleInterval` is `TimeSpan.FromDays(7)`).

A full run drains the per-provider artist-refresh queue (a Redis sorted set) in batches of
`SpotifyConstants.MaxArtistsPerBatchLookup` (50, the Spotify page limit for artists),
looks up each batch's genres, and writes them back to the cache. It pauses 100 ms between
batches to be gentle on Spotify's rate limits, and stops when the queue drains empty. An
artist that is not found is left uncached so it can be retried on a later run; an empty
genre list is a valid result and is cached. Errors in a single batch are logged and the run
continues with the next batch; errors in the loop are logged and retried after a one-minute
delay rather than crashing the host.
