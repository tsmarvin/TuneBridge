/// Spotify-local contract for batch ("several at once") lookups against Spotify's bulk endpoints,

/// <remarks>
/// This is distinct from the per-provider <see cref="BridgeBeats.Contracts.Interfaces.IMusicLookupService"/> single-entity contract:
/// it resolves many ids in one request to reduce round-trips. Batch sizes are bounded by Spotify's
/// limits, and a 429 surfaces as a rate-limit exception rather than a partial result. The interface is
/// the testability seam for <c>SpotifyBulkProcessorService</c>, since the concrete implementation is
/// constructed with HTTP/token dependencies that make direct instantiation in unit tests impractical.
