/// record can never be re-attempted more than once per freshness window (see remarks).

/// Partial-ness was previously an <c>||</c> term here. It was removed because a record a provider can
/// never complete (the provider genuinely lacks the track) stays partial forever, and a
/// partial-triggers-stale rule would re-attempt it every cycle in perpetuity — a growing, unbounded
/// drain on the budget and the rate-limited external-id search path. Age-only freshness bounds every
/// record to at most one re-attempt per window; the dropped-provider case still self-heals, just
/// once-per-window rather than every-cycle.
