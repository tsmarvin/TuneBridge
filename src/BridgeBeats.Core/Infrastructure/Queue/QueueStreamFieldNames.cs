/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// These literals are a wire contract: the values must not change without migrating in-flight
/// stream entries. A queued stream entry carries a <see cref="Payload"/> field (the serialized
/// request) and an <see cref="EnqueuedAt"/> field (when it was added). Dead-letter entries add
/// further fields that are defined privately on the request queue rather than here. Keep stream
/// NAMES (e.g. <c>SpotifyConstants.BulkTrackIdStream</c>) in their provider-specific constants
/// class; only the field names — which are generic queue wire format — live here.
